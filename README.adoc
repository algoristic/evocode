= _evocode_
Create _robocode_ robots, using https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_programming[genetic programming].

== ðŸš€ Getting Started
=== Installation
. Download _robocode_ from https://sourceforge.net/projects/robocode/files/robocode/[sourceforge.net].
. Install, using `java -jar robocode-installer.x.y.z.jar`.
  .. Install to `C:\robocode`.
. In `C:\robocode\robocode.bat` adjust the lines depending on your Java version.
. _Test run_ via `robocode.bat` or from start menu.

=== Link to eclipse
. Follow the guide https://www.robowiki.net/wiki/Robocode/Eclipse/Create_a_Project[Create a project] on https://www.robowiki.net[robowiki].
.. Add `C:\robocode\libs\robocode.jar` according to guide.
.. Link _javadoc_ according to guide.
. Also add the https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/net.sf.robocode/robocode.api[`robocode.api`] at correct version to `pom.xml` for your convenience.
. In _robocode_ under `Options > Preferences > Development Options` add your Eclipse project and...
. ...in Eclipse follow the guide https://robowiki.net/wiki/Robocode/Eclipse/Running_from_Eclipse[Running from Eclipse] to make your robots runnable and debuggable from Eclipse.

=== Misc
- Check, if this problem occurs: https://stackoverflow.com/a/70600427.

== ðŸ”§ Configuration
The configuration of the simulation happens inside a `.properties` file. This file controls the current run of the simulation as well as the general configuration of the simulation project.

=== Example
An extensive and documented configuration can be found under link:./default.properties[default.properties].

== ðŸš§ Running the application
As of now there are two possibilities to run the application:

=== Run the simulation
Run the simulation until the termination condition is met.
[source]
----
de.algoristic.evocode.EvocodeApplication
  -m,--mode     run
  -p,--project  /absolute/path/to/your/config.properties
----

=== Compile a specific individual
Compile a specific individual to its default target directory.
[source]
----
de.algoristic.evocode.EvocodeApplication
  -m,--mode        compile
  -p,--project     /absolute/path/to/your/config.properties
  -g,--generation  generation number
  -i,--individual  individual number
----

=== Compile and test a specific individual
Compile and run the test for a specific individual. (Delete all generated resources afterwards.)
[source]
----
de.algoristic.evocode.EvocodeApplication
  -m,--mode        test
  -p,--project     /absolute/path/to/your/config.properties
  -g,--generation  generation number
  -i,--individual  individual number
  -v,--visualize   [optional] set flag to display the battle

== ðŸ’¬ Consideration
You may have wondered why there is no support for concurrency/multi-threading. Well, I have also tried around with this - in fact there is no way to run multiple instances of the robocode engine (API) in eclipse. You may instantiate multiple objects, but there will be always one underlying factory, performing all tasks, resulting in no improvement in performance...

=== Sidenote (for myself)
Yes, I also considered running multiple copies of robocode (complete clones of `C:\robocode`) under `C:\robocode\<thread number>` to prevent the described problem. Sadly it is hardcoded in the robocode API to primarily use the instance that is part of the classpath of the caller.
