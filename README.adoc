Create _robocode_ robots, using https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_programming[genetic programming].

== Getting Started
=== Installation
. Download _robocode_ from https://sourceforge.net/projects/robocode/files/robocode/[sourceforge.net].
. Install, using `java -jar robocode-installer.x.y.z.jar`.
  .. Install to `C:\robocode`.
. In `C:\robocode\robocode.bat` adjust the lines depending on your Java version.
. _Test run_ via `robocode.bat` or from start menu.

=== Link to eclipse
. Follow the guide https://www.robowiki.net/wiki/Robocode/Eclipse/Create_a_Project[Create a project] on https://www.robowiki.net[robowiki].
.. Add `C:\robocode\libs\robocode.jar` according to guide.
.. Link _javadoc_ according to guide.
. Also add the https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/net.sf.robocode/robocode.api[`robocode.api`] at correct version to `pom.xml` for your convenience.
. In _robocode_ under `Options > Preferences > Development Options` add your Eclipse project and...
. ...in Eclipse follow the guide https://robowiki.net/wiki/Robocode/Eclipse/Running_from_Eclipse[Running from Eclipse] to make your robots runnable and debuggable from Eclipse.

=== Misc
- Check, if this problem occurs: https://stackoverflow.com/a/70600427.

== Configuration
The configuration of the simulation happens inside a `.properties` file.

See link:./default.properties[default.properties] for a general reference. Also see link:./genome.dna.properties[genome.dna.properties] and link:./genome.nn.properties[genome.nn.properties] for the different implementations of genetics in this project.

== Running the application
As of now there are two possibilities to run the app:

=== Run the simulation
Run: `de.algoristic.evocode.EvocodeApplication` `absolute/path/to/your/config.properties` to run a project inside the directory where your configuration file resides.

=== Run and display a specific individual
Run: `de.algoristic.evocode.EvocodeApplication` `absolute/path/to/your/config.properties` `<generation>` `<individual>` to re-run and display a already evaluated individual from a generation in that directory.

== Consideration
You may have wondered why there is no support for concurrency/multi-threading. Well, I have also tried around with this - in fact there is no way to run multiple instances of the robocode engine (API) in eclipse. You may instantiate multiple objects, but there will be always one underlying factory, performing all tasks, resulting in no improvement in performance...

=== Sidenote (for myself)
Yes, I also considered running multiple copies of robocode (complete clones of `C:\robocode`) under `C:\robocode\<thread number>` to prevent the described problem. Sadly it is hardcoded in the robocode API to primarily use the instance that is part of the classpath of the caller.
